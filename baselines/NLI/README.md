## Bias Detection using XNLI-formatted NLI with MT5

This code uses a pre-trained multilingual T5 (mT5) model, specifically mt5-large-finetuned-mnli-xtreme-xnli, to perform bias detection in explanations based on Natural Language Inference (NLI). Each example is converted into a premise-hypothesis pair and passed through the model.

Please run `NLI.py` to get bias scores on thoughts file.
